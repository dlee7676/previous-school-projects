</h2><p>This program allows the recording and playback of sound, and has a number of editing functions that can be used on a recording.  It can use either a recording taken from the computer microphone or an existing .wav file.  The program can display the waveform and frequency spectrum for a recording, and it can also cut and paste sections of the waveform or filter it for specific frequencies.  </p>

</h2><p>This program makes a source image appear to transform into a destination image.  This is done by placing control lines on each image to mark where important features are; a series of intermediate frames is then created where the pixels of the source image migrate based on the change in the position of the control lines in the destination.  The two images are also cross-dissolved as the frames advance to make the image appear to change into the other one.</p>
