This repo contains older course projects related to multimedia applications.  The "Morpher" folder contains code for a program that creates the visual effect of warping one image into another, and the "Project3931" folder contains code for a basic sound file editor.

These projects are in Java, and can be easily compiled and run out of Eclipse as long as all the source files are present.
